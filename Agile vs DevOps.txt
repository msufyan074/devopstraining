Agile:

Agile Methodology involves continuous iteration of development and testing in the SDLC process. This software development method emphasizes on 
iterative, incremental, and evolutionary development.

Agile development process breaks the product into smaller pieces and integrates them for final testing. It can be implemented in many ways, 

DevOps:

DevOps is a software development method which focuses on communication, integration, and collaboration among IT professionals to enables rapid 
deployment of products.

DevOps is a culture that promotes collaboration between Development and Operations Team. This allows deploying code to production faster and in
an automated way. It helps to increases an organization’s speed to deliver application and services. It can be defined as an alignment of 
development and IT operation.

Agile Vs DevOps:

The chief difference between Agile and DevOps is that the former is an approach that emphasizes 
iterative development using independent, cross-functional teams. At the same time, the latter is a practice that moves Operations roles into Development, creating the basis for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery).

Proponents of using both theories in appropriate business needs believe that DevOps can be seen as an extension of Agile. Agile relies on 
cross-functional teams that typically include:

A designer
A tester
A developer

DevOps takes this one step further by adding an operations person who can ease the transition from software to deployment. Because of DevOps’ inherent communication with other teams, DevOps can help automate processes and improve transparency for all teams.
