cker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing     your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.

This includes three main components that are
1) Docker Clien
2)Docker Host
3)Docker registry

1) Docker Client:

The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as docker run, the client sends these     commands to dockerd, which carries them out. The docker command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

2)Docket Host:

The Docker host provides a complete environment to execute and run applications. It comprises of the Docker daemon, Images, Containers, Networks, and Storage.

3) Docker Registry:

Docker Registry manages and stores the Docker images.

There are two types of registries in the Docker -

Pubic Registry - Public Registry is also called as Docker hub.

Private Registry - It is used to share images within the enterprise.
