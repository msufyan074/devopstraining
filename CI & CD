Continuous Integration:

Continuous integration is an automated process that merges code contributions from different developers into a central repository. It's a 
valuable DevOps practice because it allows continuous testing of new changes to code.

Continous Delivery:

Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production 
environment after the build stage.

Continous Deployment:

Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your 
production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be 
deployed to production.
